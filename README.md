# LinkedListsForC-Rex-API
I wanted to develop a API for C since it seems to be losing momentum, even though C is an excellent language, so I possibly wanted to make C more like an object oriented language without writing a compiler(because I'm lazy like that), so my API might create a new language.                                                                                                           Usage: at beginning of writing new program, you type '#include "RexAPI.h" (which is a common C statement) to get the object     oriented features in place.                                                                                                    The entire goal of this API is to create an Object oriented Language while keeping C simple(which   is something that C++ didn't accomplish). C is a simple language, One that I will intend for all beginners, but this API could shape the future of programming. So share this with your friends, family, or anyone else who programs, and get them to pitch in.    -JeromeTheFluffy, creator of RexAPI and hopefully another popular C dialect
